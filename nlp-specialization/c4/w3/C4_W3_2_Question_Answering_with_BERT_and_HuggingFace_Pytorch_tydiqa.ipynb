        "In the previous Hugging Face ungraded lab, you saw how to use the pipeline objects to use transformer models for NLP tasks. I showed you that the model didn't output the desired answers to a series of precise questions for a context related to the history of comic books.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, you will fine-tune the model from that lab to give better answers for that type of context. To do that, you'll be using the [TyDi QA dataset](https://ai.google.com/research/tydiqa) but on a filtered version with only English examples. Additionally, you will use a lot of the tools that Hugging Face has to offer.\n",
        "\n",
        "You have to note that, in general, you will fine-tune general-purpose transformer models to work for specific tasks. However, fine-tuning a general-purpose model can take a lot of time. That's why you will be using the model from the question answering pipeline in this lab.\n",
